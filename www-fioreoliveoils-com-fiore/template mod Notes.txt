	Problem:  Custom Gift & personalized gift pack must be called in to order, not purchasable on line.
		added flag meta-nonpurchasable on Custom Gift pack & Personalized
		product.liquid check for flag non-purchasable dont display price or Add to cart.
		snippets/product-block.liquid check for non-purchasable flag, dont display quick order expansion.

	problem1: Hidden products
		1. not show in all products
			- create big collection of all products EXCEPT those for the knot.
		2. not searchable from sitewide search. (for the Knot)
			for products: add flag called meta-nosearch.
			in search.liquid checked for product with tag = meta-nosearch OR page with url 'the-knot'
		3. robots.txt & metatags.
			in theme.liquid check for page title == "The Knot" or page slug =="knot" and then add
				<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow" />
			ex:     {% if page.handle == 'fiore-wedding-event-favors' %}
						<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
					{% endif %}
	[ ] Still need to hide the knot from the /products page which shows all categories (i think)

	in style.css.liquid  commented out the hide-note css (which was display: none) s.t. the cart note would always display
	not just when click on 'add not to order' link.
